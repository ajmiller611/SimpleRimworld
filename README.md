# Simple Rimworld

This project's purpose is to recreate a very simplified version of Rimworld.

After following along to Dave Churchill's COMP 4300 Intro to C++ Game Programming lectures and completing the assignments,
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s99UDGdYIUE&list=PL_xRyXins84_Jf-aCh7chj47HR4oZLPwK)
 this project is a combination of being the course project, reinforcing concepts learned, and improving my programming skills.

Simple Rimworld uses the game engine architecture that was taught in Mr. Churchill's course. The game engine is built using
C++ with an ECS(Entities, Components, Systems) architecture.

Rimworld is a game with a lot of complex systems that create the level of detailed simulation that it has.
My goal with this project is to recreate a small portion of the core gameplay. The player crash lands on a planet
and now has to fight to survive. The following game mechanics will be the focus:

- Gather materials to be used in crafting
- Use structure pieces to build a base
- Defend from enemy raids
- Use weapons to help defend the base
- Hunger system
- Simple farm for crops
